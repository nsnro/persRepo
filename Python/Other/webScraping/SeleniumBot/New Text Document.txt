Iâ€™m looking for a Python Selenium expert who will make a bot for me to scrap the odd multipliers from a gambling site shown above. I also want all the most important elements to be selected using Xpaths, IDS, Classes, or Css selectors. The bot should be able to print the odds into the terminal.
The site URL is=======  https://www.betika.com/en-ke/aviator
